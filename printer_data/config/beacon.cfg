serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Beacon_Beacon_RevH_33066C585154354D38202020FF0A280F-if00 # The unique hardware ID for the Beacon sensor's USB connection
x_offset: 0 # The horizontal distance between the nozzle and the center of the sensor
y_offset: 24 # The vertical distance between the nozzle and the center of the sensor
mesh_main_direction: x # Sets the primary axis the toolhead moves along during a bed mesh scan
mesh_runs: 2 # The number of scanning passes performed to verify and average the mesh data

[bed_mesh]
algorithm: bicubic # Uses smooth curved interpolation for the mesh; better for larger beds than 'lagrange'
speed: 300 # The travel speed in mm/s between probe points during the calibration process
horizontal_move_z: 5 # The Z height the toolhead lifts to while moving from one point to the next
mesh_min: 20, 20 # The starting X,Y coordinates for the probe grid (bottom-left corner)
mesh_max: 326, 326 # The ending X,Y coordinates for the probe grid (top-right corner)
probe_count: 10, 10 # Defines a 10x10 grid, which will take a total of 100 measurement points

[resonance_tester] # Section used to measure printer vibrations for Input Shaper calibration
accel_chip: beacon # Informs Klipper to use the onboard accelerometer within the Beacon sensor
probe_points: 173, 173, 20 # The X, Y, and Z coordinates where the toolhead will stay while shaking to measure resonance
